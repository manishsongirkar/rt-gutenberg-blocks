# Custom Gutenberg Block

Examples of gutenberg custom blocks based on [Simple Gutenberg Boilerplate for plugin development](https://github.com/rtCamp/gutenberg-plugin-boilerplate)

## Custom blocks I've created:

- Timeline
	- User can add Title, WP contributors list (as content for now), Release date, Release News and Blog post link. 
- Case study excerpt
	- User can upload/change case study image, add title and excerpt content and can add case study article link. 

## How to use ?

- Run `npm install` to install plugin dependencies.
- For development build use `npm run dev` command.
- For production build use `npm run build` command.
